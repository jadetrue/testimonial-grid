## My process

### Built with

- [CRA](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) ❤️
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Recently I've been so used to using TypeScript, that I thought I'd attempt a project without it! This particular challenged me to focus on what I am doing. I spent a couple of hours just figuring out why my data wasn't loading and it wasn't until I realised I had given my file the wrong extension name (.tsx instead of .jsx)!

### Continued development

I am attempting different sections of React at a time. This particular time was to use `useContext()` from scratch and implement it from just the knowledge I've built up over time.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Tools](https://www.tailwind-tools.com/) - This is an amazing tool that helped me with the grid layout for this particular piece of work.
